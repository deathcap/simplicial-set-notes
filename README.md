## Graphs in higher dimensions

[Graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph) are fundamental in computer science. Everywhere you go, you hear people talking about networks, connections and other graph like euphemisms.  Graphs are used to model all sorts of things:

* [Social networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network)
* [Distributed systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)
* [Ecological networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_network)
* [The human brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network)

But graphs are 1 dimensional structures (even though they can be embedded in higher dimensional spaces), and in geometry they are often insufficient to describe the sorts of objects which we are interested in, like surfaces and solids. However, topology in 1-dimension can be deceptively simple, and in carrying out the generalization of graphs to higher dimensional spaces there are multiple possibilities.

### Cell complexes

There are multiple ways to generalize graphs, though the most successful has been the concept of a [cell complex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_cell_complex). Cell complexes are made out of simple units called *cells*, which are then glued together to form a larger and more complex space. Types of cell complexes differ in the sorts of cells that they allow and the ways in which they are glued together. For example, [CW complexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex) are a popular mathematical formulation for spaces in [homotopy theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy). In a CW complex, cells can be any [contractible space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractible_space), and the binding relations are arbitrary [homeomorphisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism). This generality is mathematically convenient for constructing and reasoning about spaces on paper, but it does not lend itself well to representation on a computer. Instead, other more limited definitions are often used.
